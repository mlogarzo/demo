# Demo
In this scenario, the goal is to launch an MVP/demo quickly, adding best practices without overkill to manage it.
I would use Amazon Elastic Container Service, you only pay per compute on instances.
Although it can be slow to scale, and is more expensive, I would choose Fargate for compute instances to avoid overhead infrastructure.
